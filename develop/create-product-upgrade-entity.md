# Create a product upgrade entity for a customer

[!INCLUDE [<Preview content warning>](<../includes/preview.md>)]

Applies to:

- Partner Center

You can create a product upgrade entity to upgrade a customer to a given product family (for example, Azure plan) using the **ProductUpgradeRequest** resource.

## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports authentication with App+User credentials. Follow the [secure app model](enable-secure-app-model.md) when using App+User authentication with Partner Center APIs.
- The customer identifier.
- The product family to which you want to upgrade the customer.

## C\#

To upgrade a customer to Azure plan:

1. Create a **ProductUpgradesRequest** object and specify the customer identifier and "Azure" as the product family.
2. Use the **IAggregatePartner.ProductUpgrades** collection.
3. Call the **Create** method and pass in the **ProductUpgradesRequest** object, which will return a **location header** string.
4. Extract the **upgrade-id** from the location header string which can be used to [query the upgrade status](get-product-upgrade-status.md).

```csharp
// IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;

string selectedCustomerId = "58e2af4f-0ad3-4688-8744-be2357cd939a";

string selectedProductFamily = "Azure";

var productUpgradeRequest = new ProductUpgradesRequest
{
    CustomerId = selectedCustomerId,
    ProductFamily = selectedProductFamily
};

var productUpgradeLocationHeader = partnerOperations.ProductUpgrades.Create(productUpgradeRequest);

var upgradeId = Regex.Split(productUpgradeLocationHeader, "/")[1];

```

## REST

### REST request

#### Request syntax

#### Request headers

For more information, see [Partner Center REST headers](headers.md).

#### Request body

The request body must contain a [ProductUpgradeRequest](product-upgrade-resources.md#productupgraderequest) resource.

### REST response

If successful, the response contains a **Location** header that has a URI that can be used to retrieve product upgrade status. Save this URI for use with other related REST APIs.

#### Response success and error codes

Each response comes with an HTTP status code that indicates success or failure and additional debugging information. Use a network trace tool to read this code, error type, and additional parameters. For the full list, see [Partner Center REST error codes](error-codes.md).
