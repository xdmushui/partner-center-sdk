While you are initially writing and testing your code, you should use your integration sandbox account (and the corresponding tokens) so that you don't accidentally incur new charges that your company is responsible for paying. For more information about this testing environment, see [Set up API access in Partner Center](set-up-api-access-in-partner-center.md).

When your solution is tested and ready to use on real customer accounts, you'll have to update your tokens so that you're using an Azure AD client app and secret that correspond to your Primary Partner Center account.

For tips and suggestions about testing and debugging, including more information about Test-in-Production (TiP) and the Integration Sandbox, see [Test and debug](test-and-debug.md).
