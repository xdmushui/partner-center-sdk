# Verify an indirect reseller's Microsoft Partner Agreement signing status

**Applies to:**

- Partner Center
- Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

You can verify whether an indirect reseller has signed the Microsoft Partner Agreement using their Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) ID (PGA/PLA) or Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) tenant ID (Microsoft ID). You can use one of these identifiers to check the Microsoft Partner Agreement signing status using the **AgreementStatus** API.

## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports authentication with App+User credentials only.

- The MPN ID (PGA/PLA) or the CSP tenant ID (Microsoft ID) of the indirect reseller. *You must use one of these two identifiers.*

## C\#

To get the Microsoft Partner Agreement signature status of an indirect reseller:

1. Use your **IAggregatePartner.Compliance** collection to call the **AgreementSignatureStatus** property.

2. Call the [**Get()**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.compliance.iagreementsignaturestatus.get) or [**GetAsync()**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.compliance.iagreementsignaturestatus.getasync) method.

``` csharp
// IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;

var agreementSignatureStatusByMpnId = partnerOperations.Compliance.AgreementSignatureStatus.Get(mpnId:"Enter MPN Id (PGA/PLA)");

var agreementSignatureStatusByTenantId = partnerOperations.Compliance.AgreementSignatureStatus.Get(tenantId: "Enter Tenant Id");
```

- Sample: **[Console test app](console-test-app.md)**
- Project: **PartnerCenterSDK.FeaturesSamples**
- Class: **GetAgreementSignatureStatus.cs**
