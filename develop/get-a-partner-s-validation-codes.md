# Get a partner's validation codes

How to get a collection of a partner's Government Community Cloud validation codes. A validation code is required to create a customer in the government community cloud.

If you are interested in having your organization or your customer's organization approved for Office 365 Government GCC for CSP, see [Office 365 Government GCC for CSP Partner and Customer eligibility criteria](/partner-center/csp-gcc-validate.md).

## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports authentication with both standalone App and App+User credentials.

- Confirmed validation after filling out form [here](https://products.office.com/government/eligibility-validation?ReqType=CSPPartner).

- A customer without a qualification.

## C\#

To get a list of all of a partner's validation codes, call **GetValidationCodes**.

``` csharp
// create the partner operations
IAggregatePartner partnerOperations = PartnerService.Instance.CreatePartnerOperations(credentials);

var gccValidations = partnerOperations.Validations.GetValidationCodes();
```
