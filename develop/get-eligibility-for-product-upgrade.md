# Check a customer's eligibility for upgrading to an Azure plan

**Applies to:**

- Partner Center

You can use the [**ProductUpgradeRequest**](product-upgrade-resources.md#productupgraderequest) resource to check if a customer is eligible to upgrade to an Azure plan from a Microsoft Azure (MS-AZR-0145P) subscription This method returns a [**ProductUpgradesEligibility**](product-upgrade-resources.md#productupgradeseligibility) resource with the customer's product upgrade eligibility.

## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports authentication with App+User credentials. Follow the [secure app model](enable-secure-app-model.md) when using App+User authentication with Partner Center APIs.

- A customer ID (`customer-tenant-id`). If you don't know the customer's ID, you can look it up in the Partner Center [dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard). Select **CSP** from the Partner Center menu, followed by **Customers**. Select the customer from the customer list, then select **Account**. On the customer’s Account page, look for the **Microsoft ID** in the **Customer Account Info** section. The Microsoft ID is the same as the customer ID  (`customer-tenant-id`).

- The product family.

## C\#

To check if a customer is eligible to upgrade to Azure plan:

1. Create a **ProductUpgradesRequest** object and specify the customer identifier and "Azure" as the product family.

2. Use the **IAggregatePartner.ProductUpgrades** collection.
3. Call the **CheckEligibility** method and pass in the **ProductUpgradesRequest** object, which will return a **ProductUpgradesEligibility** object.

```csharp
// IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;

string selectedCustomerId = "58e2af4f-0ad3-4688-8744-be2357cd939a";

string selectedProductFamily = "azure";

var productUpgradeRequest = new ProductUpgradesRequest
{
    CustomerId = selectedCustomerId,
    ProductFamily = selectedProductFamily
};

ProductUpgradesEligibility productUpgradeEligibility = partnerOperations.ProductUpgrades.CheckEligibility(productUpgradeRequest);

if (productUpgradeEligibility.IsEligibile)
{
    ....
}

```
