## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports authentication with both standalone App and App+User credentials.

- A customer ID (`customer-tenant-id`). If you don't know the customer's ID, you can look it up in the Partner Center [dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard). Select **CSP** from the Partner Center menu, followed by **Customers**. Select the customer from the customer list, then select **Account**. On the customer’s Account page, look for the **Microsoft ID** in the **Customer Account Info** section. The Microsoft ID is the same as the customer ID  (`customer-tenant-id`).

## Making a one-time purchase

To make a one-time purchase, use the following steps:

1. [Enablement](#enablement) - (Azure Reserved VM Instance only) Register an active CSP Azure subscription to enable it for purchasing any reservation product.

2. [Discovery](#discovery) - Find and select the products and SKUs you want to purchase and check their availability.

3. [Order submission](#order-submission) - Create a shopping cart with the items in your order and submit it.

4. [Get order details](#get-order-details) - Review the details of an order, all the orders for a customer, or view orders by billing cycle type.

After you have made your one-time purchase, the following scenarios show you how to manage the lifecycle of your products by getting information about your entitlements, and how to retrieve balance statements, invoices, and invoice summaries.

- [Lifecycle management](#lifecycle-management)

- [Invoice and reconciliation](#invoice-and-reconciliation)

## Enablement

Once you have identified the active subscription that you want to add the Azure Reserved VM Instance to, you must register the subscription so that it is enabled. To register an existing [Subscription](subscription-resources.md) resource so that it is enabled, see [Register a subscription](register-a-subscription.md).

After registering your subscription, you should confirm that the registration process is completed by checking the registration status. To do this step, see [Get subscription registration status](get-subscription-registration-status.md).

## Discovery

Once the subscription is enabled, you're ready to select products and SKUs and check their availability using the following Partner Center API models:

- [Product](product-resources.md#product) - A grouping construct for purchasable goods or services. A product by itself isn't a purchasable item.

- [SKU](product-resources.md#sku) - A purchasable Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) under a product. SKUs represent the different shapes of the product.

- [Availability](product-resources.md#availability) - A configuration in which a SKU is available for purchase (such as country, currency, and industry segment).

Before making a one-time purchase, complete the following steps:

1. Identify and retrieve the Product and SKU that you want to purchase. You can do this step by listing the products and SKUs first, or if you already know the IDs of the product and SKU, selecting them.

   - [Get a list of products](get-a-list-of-products.md)
   - [Get a product using the product ID](get-a-product-by-id.md)
   - [Get a list of SKUs for a product](get-a-list-of-skus-for-a-product.md)
   - [Get a SKU using the SKU ID](get-a-sku-by-id.md)

2. Check the inventory for a SKU. This step is only needed for SKUs that are tagged with an **InventoryCheck** prerequisite.

   - [Check Inventory](check-inventory.md)

3. Retrieve the [availability](product-resources.md#availability) for the [SKU](product-resources.md#sku). You will need the **CatalogItemId** of the availability when placing the order. To get this value, use one of the following APIs:

   - [Get a list of availabilities for a SKU](get-a-list-of-availabilities-for-a-sku.md)
   - [Get an availability using the availability ID](get-an-availability-by-id.md)

## Order submission

To submit your order, follow these steps:

1. Create a cart to hold the collection of catalog items that you intend to buy. When you create a [Cart](cart-resources.md), the [cart line items](cart-resources.md#cartlineitem) are automatically grouped based on what can be purchased together in the same [Order](order-resources.md).

   - [Create a shopping cart](create-a-cart.md)
   - [Update a shopping cart](update-a-cart.md)

2. Check out the cart. Checking out a cart results in the creation of an [Order](order-resources.md).

   - [Checkout the cart](checkout-a-cart.md)

## Get order details

Once you have created your order, you can retrieve the details of an individual order using the order ID, or get a list of orders for a customer. There is a delay of up to 15 minutes between the time an order is submitted and when it will appear in a list of a customer's orders.

- To get the details of an individual order using the order ID. See, [Get an order by ID](get-an-order-by-id.md).

- To get a list of orders for a customer using the customer ID. See, [Get all of a customer's orders](get-all-of-a-customer-s-orders.md).

- To get a list of orders for a customer by [billing cycle type](product-resources.md#billingcycletype) allowing you to list orders (one-time charges) and annual or monthly billed orders separately. See, [Get a list of orders by customer and billing cycle type](get-a-list-of-orders-by-customer-and-billing-cycle-type.md).

## Lifecycle management

As part of managing the lifecycle of your one-time purchases in Partner Center, you can retrieve information about your [Entitlements](entitlement-resources.md), and get reservation details using the reservation order ID. For examples of how to do this, see [Get entitlements](get-a-collection-of-entitlements.md).

## Invoice and reconciliation

The following scenarios show you how to programmatically view your customer's [invoices](invoice-resources.md), and get your account balances and summaries that include one-time charges.

### Balance and payment

To get current account balance in your default currency type that is a balance of both recurring and one-time charges, see [Get your current account balance](get-the-reseller-s-current-account-balance.md)

### Multi-currency balance and payment

To get your current account balance and a collection of invoice summaries containing an invoice summary with both recurring and one-time charges for each of your customer's currency types, see [Get invoice summaries](get-invoice-summaries.md).

### Invoices

To get a collection of invoices that show both recurring and one time charges, see [Get a collection of invoices](get-a-collection-of-invoices.md).

### Single Invoice

To retrieve a specific invoice using the invoice ID, see [Get an invoice by ID](get-invoice-by-id.md).

### Reconciliation

To get a collection of invoice line item details (Reconciliation line items) for a specific invoice ID, see [Get invoice line items](get-invoiceline-items.md).

### Download an invoice as a PDF

To retrieve an invoice statement in PDF form using an invoice ID, see [Get an invoice statement](get-invoice-statement.md).
