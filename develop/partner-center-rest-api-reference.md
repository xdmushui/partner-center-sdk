## Partner Center REST API

The Partner Center REST API helps Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners integrate their existing CRM or billing software with the Microsoft systems that manage customer accounts, place orders, manage subscriptions, and handle support requests.

For more information about what the API can do, including sample code, see the [Scenarios](scenarios.md) topic, including the background overview.

Before you begin coding, read the [Get started](get-started.md) topic. This article contains information about setting up your test and production accounts, getting authentication working, and finding the sample code.

For a reference guide explaining each API, see [Partner Center REST API](/rest/api/partner-center-rest/).
