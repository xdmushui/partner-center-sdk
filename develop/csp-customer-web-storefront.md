# CSP customer web storefront

**Applies to:**

- Partner Center

> [!NOTE]
> This sample app applies only to the global instance of Partner Center. It does not apply to Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany or to Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government.

The [Partner Center storefront](https://github.com/Microsoft/Partner-Center-Storefront) is a **sample website** for an online store that customers can use to buy subscriptions to Microsoft products. You can modify this **sample code** for your own use to [configure the offers](#configure-offers), [add branding](#configure-branding) and [add a payment method](#configure-payment-types).

## Sample code

Download the [Partner Center storefront sample code](https://github.com/Microsoft/Partner-Center-Storefront) from GitHub.

## Configure authentication

Before you build the application, update the following values in the Web.config file to reflect the Azure AD authentication information you created in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). You should use your integration sandbox account settings during early development or for testing in production (TiP).

- **partnerCenter.applicationId**
- **partnerCenter.applicationSecret**
- **partnerCenter.domain**
- **webPortal.clientId**
- **webPortal.clientSecret**
- **webPortal.domain**
- **webPortal.azureStorageConnectionString**

## Configure offers

You can configure the set of offers (**MicrosoftOffer**) in the **OfferCatalogViewModel**.

## Configure branding

This sample website tracks the following company and brand information in *BrandingConfiguration.cs* and *PortalBranding.cs*:

- Organization name
- Organization logo
- Header image
- Privacy agreement
- Contact email
- Contact phone number

### Configure payment types

The app currently uses a PayPal gateway, implemented in *PayPalGateway.cs*.
