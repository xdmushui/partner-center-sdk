# Get the status of a customer's direct signing (direct acceptance) of Microsoft Customer Agreement

**Applies to**: Partner Center

The **DirectSignedCustomerAgreementStatus** resource is currently supported by Partner Center only in the Microsoft public cloud.

**Does not apply to**: Partner Center operated by 21Vianet | Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany | Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

This article explains how you can retrieve the status of a customer's direct acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement.

## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports authentication with App+User credentials only.

- A customer ID (`customer-tenant-id`). If you don't know the customer's ID, you can look it up in the Partner Center [dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard). Select **CSP** from the Partner Center menu, followed by **Customers**. Select the customer from the customer list, then select **Account**. On the customer's Account page, look for the **Microsoft ID** in the **Customer Account Info** section. The Microsoft ID is the same as the customer ID  (`customer-tenant-id`).

## C\#

To retrieve the status of a customer's direct acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement, call the [**IAggregatePartner.Customers.ById**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.customers.icustomercollection.byid) method with the customer identifier. Then use the [**Agreements**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.customers.icustomer.agreements) property to retrieve a [**ICustomerAgreementCollection**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.agreements.icustomeragreementcollection) interface. Finally, call `GetDirectSignedCustomerAgreementStatus()` or `GetDirectSignedCustomerAgreementStatusAsync()` to retrieve the status.

``` csharp
// IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;
// string customerId;
var customerDirectSigningStatus = partnerOperations.Customers.ById(selectedCustomerId).Agreements.GetDirectSignedCustomerAgreementStatus();
```

**Sample**: [Console Sample App](https://github.com/microsoft/Partner-Center-DotNet-Samples). **Project**: SdkSamples **Class**: GetDirectSignedCustomerAgreementStatus.cs

## REST request

To retrieve the status of a customer's direct acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement,
create a REST request to retrieve the [DirectSignedCustomerAgreementStatus](./customer-agreement-direct-sign-status-resource.md) for the customer.

### Request syntax

Use the following request syntax:

| Method | Request URI                                                                                      |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | [*\{baseURL\}*](partner-center-rest-urls.md)/v1/customers/{customer-tenant-id}/directSignedMicrosoftCustomerAgreementStatus HTTP/1.1 |

### URI parameters

You can use the following URI parameters with your request:

| Name             | Type | Required | Description                                                                               |
|------------------|------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Request headers

For more information, see [Partner Center REST headers](headers.md).

### Request body

### Request example

```http
GET https://api.partnercenter.microsoft.com/v1/customers/14876998-c0dc-46e6-9d0c-65a57a6c32ec/directSignedMicrosoftCustomerAgreementStatus HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accept: application/json
MS-RequestId: 94e4e214-6b06-4fb7-96d1-94d559f9b47f
MS-CorrelationId: ab993325-1605-4cf4-bac4-fb584142a31b
```

## REST response

If successful, this method returns a [**DirectSignedCustomerAgreementStatus** resource](./customer-agreement-direct-sign-status-resource.md) in the response body.

The resource has an **isSigned** property that indicates the customer's direct signing (direct acceptance) status.

- A value of **true** indicates that the agreement has been signed (accepted) directly by the customer.

- A value of **false** indicates that the agreement has *not* been signed (accepted) directly by the customer.

### Response success and error codes

Each response comes with an HTTP status code that indicates success or failure and additional debugging information.

Use a network trace tool to read this code, error type, and additional parameters. For the full list, see [Partner Center REST error codes](error-codes.md).

### Response example

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 20
Content-Type: application/json
MS-RequestId: 94e4e214-6b06-4fb7-96d1-94d559f9b47f
