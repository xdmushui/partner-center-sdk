# Get invoice summaries

**Applies to:**

- Partner Center
- Partner Center operated by 21Vianet
- Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany
- Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

You can use the **InvoiceSummaries** to retrieve an invoice summary which shows the balance and total charges of both recurring and one-time charges. The **InvoiceSummaries** resource contains an invoice summary for each currency type.

## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports authentication with App+User credentials only.

- A valid invoice identifier.

## C\#

To retrieve an [**InvoiceSummaries**](invoice-resources.md#invoicesummaries) collection that contains an [**InvoiceSummary**](invoice-resources.md#invoicesummary) for each currency type:

1. Use your **IAggregatePartner.Invoices** collection to call the **Summaries** property.

2. Call the **Get()** method.
3. To get the balance of an individual [**InvoiceSummary**](invoice-resources.md#invoicesummary), access the **BalanceAmount** property for that member of the collection.

``` csharp
// IAggregatePartner scopedPartnerOperations;

// Get the invoice summaries collection.
var invoiceSummaries = scopedPartnerOperations.Invoices.Summaries.Get();

// Display the balance on the first invoice summary in the collection.
Console.Out.WriteLine("Current Account Balance:  {0:C}", invoiceSummaries[0].BalanceAmount);
```

For more information, see the following example code:

- Sample: [Console test app](console-test-app.md)
- Project: **PartnerSDK.FeatureSample**
- Class: **GetInvoiceSummaries.cs**
